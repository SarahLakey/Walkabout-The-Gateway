The goal of this project is to implement an online step tracker platform to satiate users’ curiosity about St. Louis while incentivizing walking for fitness or leisure. Our group found that current step trackers are missing features that could improve engagement and user experience so we developed a fake user to showcase how this can help people make healthier habits with this gamified approach. This platform provides a way to build a community by encouraging communication and interaction among neighbors and tourists in your area.
